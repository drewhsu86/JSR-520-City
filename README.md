# JSR-520 City
Final Project for JSR-520, General Assembly's Javascript Remote Web Dev Course 

## Summary 
As I've gone through the Javascript web development course, I've learned many things such as Javascript, calling APIs, React, Firebase (backend). I've put all of these things together in a playground of sorts to help remind me of all that I've learned. This is more of a casual project that tries to remind people that programming is fun and web development is also about engaging the user.

[Deployed on Firebase](https://jsr520class.firebaseapp.com/)

## Tech Stack 
React and Javascript on the frontend. Most of the heavy lifting for this app is done on the frontend. I played around with doing a sign in page using Firebase on the backend but I didn't really continue much past that because I didn't plan out an app that requires a lot of persistent data. I also ended up hosting on Firebase. This was more of an app that really practices building many React components in order to create interactive pages, dialogue boxes, and games (Blackjack and a Where's Waldo clone).
